Since red light doesn’t\npenetrate to the Atolla’s favored depths of 1,000-\n4,000 meters, it actually appears completely black\nto predators, letting it hide in plain sight."},

  {"factid":"3", "knowledge":"Did you know?\n\nAtolla jellyfish are not exactly discerning about\nwhat they eat. They’ll grab any prey animal\nswimming by with their tentacles, including a\nparticularly long one that can coil up or extend.\nThis tentacle might also be used for reproduction."},
